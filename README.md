<h2>Develop ExtraWorks with FlowWorks</h2>
<i>https://github.com/MBijron/ExtraWorks.git</i>
<p>
    If you use ExtraWorks. It is recommended to clone the repository in the FlowWorks root.
    The name should never be "extraworks" because FlowWorks will use it as the client extraworks folder
    and might overwrite stuff. The suggested name is "extraworks_dev".
    Cloning ExtraWorks in the FlowWorks folder will make sure all python files inside the packages
    will get refactored when PyWorks does.
